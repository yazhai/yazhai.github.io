        <li> 2018 - Present: Ph.D. Candidate at Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego <br>
          Research Interests: My focus lies in learning and search methodologies, 
          non-convex and global optimization, and black-box optimization. 
          In terms of applications, I am particularly interested in the use of machine learning algorithms in 
          molecular dynamics simulations, chip designs, and protein designs.
